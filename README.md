how to run code: 
1. go to the starting page of the repository 
2. click "Code" 
3. select "Download ZIP"
4. right click ZIP file and choose to extract the ZIP (name of option may vary depending on software used to extract)
5. open the "Index.html" file with your browser (tested with google chrome, if it doesn't work with your default, try using chrome)

possible future improvements: 
1. labels for each location, for when the marker is on it
2. ability to redo cycle (currently requires the page be refreshed)
3. option to choose from the set individual locations (after a full cycle has completed, both to show options, and prevent issues)
4. visual transition from location to location, making it easier to track
